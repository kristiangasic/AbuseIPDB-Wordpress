## How It Works

The plugin monitors failed attempts to access sensitive files on your WordPress site. If an IP tries to access a protected file multiple times within a given timeframe, the IP will be reported to AbuseIPDB.

### Targeted Files:
The plugin monitors the following files:
- `xmlrpc.php`
- `wp-admin.php`
- `wp-login.php`
- `install.php`
- `readme.html`
- `.env`
- `.git`
- `phpmyadmin`
- `wp-config.php`
- `license.txt`

If a suspicious IP triggers multiple failed attempts, it will be reported to AbuseIPDB for further investigation.
